# House_Price_Prediction_Regression_Model
To create a multiple linear regression model to forecast home prices based on a number of significant variables identified by a stepwise regression analysis. In addition, metric independent variable factor analysis will be performed to see how they might be grouped or decreased to a smaller number. 

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study is to utilize stepwise linear regression to pinpoint the variables that, with a high degree of confidence, may account for the majority of variance in sales price of a home. Consequently, the goals of this investigation are:
1. To ascertain whether the size or area of the garage has an impact on the cost. The assumption is that a larger house will sell for more money.
2. To determine if number of fireplaces in a house is linearly related to the price of it. It is expected that more the number of fireplaces in a house, higher is its price.
3. To determine if above grade living area i.e., area of living that is above ground level, affects the overall sales price. It is expected that higher the value of this variable, the higher is the sales price. 
As a result, the suggested null hypotheses for these three goals are shown below-
1. Ho: The area of garage has a negative linear relationship with sales price.
2. Ho: The number of fireplaces in a house has a negative linear relationship with sales price. 
3. Ho: The area of living above grade has a negative linear relationship with sales price. 
Alternative hypotheses can be put forth if significant results (p-value < 0.05) are obtained in opposition to these null hypotheses.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The goal of this study was to create a stepwise multiple linear regression model on the home pricing dataset to investigate how different factors affect sales price. Three hypotheses were put forth, and the other hypotheses can be adopted based on figure-3 zero order correlation and figure-10 t-value test results. Additionally, it was determined that the final model was capable of statistically explaining 80.5% of the variation in home price.
A number of changes might be made to this study. Data exploration may be done in greater depth. Outliers can be found and considered. Before developing a model, methods like feature scaling or standardization might be used. Additionally, offered hypotheses can be thoroughly investigated.
